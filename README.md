# wallet_management

TD BLOCKCHAIN PROGRAMMING - 2022/2023

# Aim of the work
The purpose of this TD is to manage a wallet. In other to achieve this, we'll go through two big steps.

# Generating of a secured seed of a wallet and Import of a mnemonic seed - based on BIP-39
The process is described as follow :

# Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed - Generating Master Keys and Children Keys - based on BIP-32
The process is described as follow :

*I found it hard to generate children keys. However, i tried some code based on some external ressources and my comprehension of the process*

# Constraints
  - No imported precompiled libraries (EG Bitcoin lib)
  - Use of Python or JS (Python in our case)
  - Allow to use libraries for maths, the generation of public keys, code verification


*The code isn't in his final state. Still have some issues. To be continued....*
